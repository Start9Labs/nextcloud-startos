# Connecting Joplin to Nextcloud

This guide will go over how to connect Joplin running on a Desktop machine to your Embassy's Nextcloud over LAN.

This guide assumes your Nextcloud username is _embassy_

It also assumes that you have set up LAN on your desktop machine. If you still need to do that, please head here - https://docs.start9.com/latest/user-manual/connecting/connecting-lan/
