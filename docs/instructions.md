# Welcome to Nextcloud

A safe home for all your data. Access & share your files, calendars, contacts, mail & more from any device, on your terms.

Nextcloud is powerful and extensive software.  It even has its own app store!  It is important to realize that while these apps will generally work, not all of them have been tested on Embassy and there may be some limitations.  It is a good idea to avoid experimental apps.


## Usage Instructions

1. Copy/paste your Nextcloud Tor address into any Tor-enabled browser.
2. Insert your default username and password. These are located in `Properties`.
3. Bookmark the site for future visits, or better yet, save it to your Bitwarden server!
4. Optionally change your default username/password.
