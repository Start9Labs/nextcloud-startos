    description: "Use this if your UI has gotten stuck in 'Maintenance Mode.'  Please keep in mind that it is normal for this mode to engage (temporarily) following an update (including NC app updates) or restart.  The typical solution is to BE PATIENT and give it plenty of opportunity to progress organically.  Resort to this action only if necessary."

    name: "Setup Map for Memories"
    description: "This sets up the map for reverse geotagging (finding the location of) your photos in the Memories application.  This mostly consists of downloading map data.  You MUST install the Memories app before running this Action, and you will want to run the \"Index Media for Memories\" Action after completion."
    warning: "This is an intensive process that will require non-trivial system resources and time.  On an Embassy Pro this will take a few minutes, and on an Embassy One, may take up to an hour.  If you are on a device with lower resources, it is best to not perform other intensive processes (such as Bitcoin's initial blockchain download) at the same time.  This action will consume approximately 2-3 GB of disk space."
