    description: "Use this if your UI has gotten stuck in 'Maintenance Mode.'  Please keep in mind that it is normal for this mode to engage (temporarily) following an update (including some NC app updates) or restart.  The typical solution is to BE PATIENT and allow the opportunity for organic progress.  Resort to this action only if necessary.  Being in maintenance mode for more than 15min likely constitutes 'being stuck.'"

    warning: "This is an intensive process that will require non-trivial system resources and time.  On a 2023 Server One, this may take up to an hour.  If you are on a device with lower resources, it is best to not perform other intensive processes (such as Bitcoin's initial blockchain download) at the same time.  This action will consume approximately 2-3 GB of disk space, and you can check progress by viewing the amount of geometries populated to the database under Admin Settings -> Memories -> Reverse Geotagging (complete set is ~561,000)."
