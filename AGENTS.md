# AGENTS.md

This is a StartOS service-package repository — it builds a `.s9pk` for StartOS.

Develop it inside a StartOS packaging workspace created by `start-cli s9pk init-workspace`,
which provides the packaging guide and agent context one level up. If you're reading this in a
bare clone with no workspace, the full guide is at <https://docs.start9.com/packaging>.

**Start every task at the recipe index** — `../start-technologies/projects/start-sdk/docs/src/recipes.md`
(or <https://docs.start9.com/packaging/recipes.html>). It maps an intent ("prompt the user to create
admin credentials", "expose a web UI") to the constructs, the reference pages, and a named production
package to copy. Find the recipe before you read this package's neighbours: a package you reach by
grepping may be non-conformant, and the recipe outranks it.

Freshly scaffolded? Work the
[New Package Checklist](../start-technologies/projects/start-sdk/docs/src/new-package-checklist.md)
(or <https://docs.start9.com/packaging/new-package-checklist.html>) from top to bottom. It is a
guide page, not a file in this repo — read it, don't copy it in.

Keep `README.md` (technical reference for an AI support or administering agent) and
`instructions.md` (end-user docs) in sync with your changes. This file restates neither:
whoever changes the package has both, so it carries only what they don't — repo mechanics,
a change that looks right and is not, where the next thing gets added, a naming trap, a
build or test invocation particular to this repo.

**Fix a defect you spot rather than reporting it** — you have the package open and the
context to be sure. File **a GitHub issue on this repo** only when the call isn't yours to
make: you can't pin the cause down, two defensible fixes exist, or it's too large to ride on
the work in hand. An open issue is a report, not a queue — implement one when you're asked
to or when it's labelled `Approved`, then close it with `Closes #<n>`.

Don't record work in the repo instead: no `TODO.md`, no `NOTES.md`, no `PLAN.md`. What you
verified, tried, and decided belongs in the commit message and the PR body.

## This repo

- **Keep `guardUpstreamUpgrade` ahead of `versionGraph` in `setupInit`**, because a volume StartOS could not snapshot keeps whatever data version the graph advanced to.
- **When renaming an action that has a live task, call `sdk.action.clearTask(effects, '<old key>')` in the same release**: the old replay key no longer resolves, so nothing else ever removes the task.
- **Give a new queued `occ` task matching entries in `ACTION_IDS`, `OCC_ARGS` and `TASK_NOTICE`, plus a conditional health check**, or it is never run or reported.
- **Edit `startos/fileModels/php.pegjs` and run `npm run regen-parser`; never edit `php-parser.js` by hand.** The build does not read the grammar, so a skipped regeneration still builds and ships the old parser.
- **Add an external-storage source as an entry in `startos/externalStorage.ts`, a typed `mountDependency` in `main.ts` and a dependency in `startos/dependencies.ts`**: the action and the reconcile pick up everything else from that registry.
- **Re-read `/entrypoint.sh` when bumping the image**: install and upgrade progress phases key off its log lines, and a reworded line fails nothing.
